├── test_search.py          # Main Selenium test script (Brave + DuckDuckGo)

## 🚀 How to Run the Test

### 📦 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🧪 2. Run the test script

```bash
python test_search.py
```

The script will:

- Open Brave browser
- Navigate to DuckDuckGo
- Perform a search for **"DevOps testing"**
- Extract and display the top results
- Save results to `results.txt`
- Print total duration of the test

---

## 📄 Sample Output

```
🔎 Resultados encontrados: 10
1. What is DevOps? | IBM
2. DevOps testing explained | Atlassian
...
📄 Resultados guardados en 'resultados.txt'
✅ Prueba funcional completada correctamente.
⏱ Tiempo total de ejecución: 4.82 segundos
```

---

## 🔐 Important Notes

- Make sure `chromedriver.exe` is in your system's PATH.
- Brave must be installed at:

```
C:\Program Files\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application\brave.exe
```

- You can change the search term directly in `test_search.py`.

## ✅ Best Practices Applied

| ✅  | Principle          | Implementation                      |
| --- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| ✅  | Real browser test  | Brave used with real search site    |
| ✅  | Wait strategies    | Uses explicit waits (WebDriverWait) |
| ✅  | Result persistence | Saves results in `results.txt`      |
| ✅  | Timing included    | Reports total test duration         |

## 🖼️ Screenshots

During the test, the script automatically captures a screenshot of the DuckDuckGo results page after performing the search.

| File Path                 | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `screenshots/results.png` | Visual snapshot of the test result page |

## This screenshot is especially useful when running the test in **CI/CD environments** like GitHub Actions. It allows reviewers to validate the UI and confirm the test behavior visually.

> ✅ The folder is created dynamically by the script if it doesn't exist.

If you're using GitHub Actions, you can upload the screenshot as an artifact using:

```yaml
- name: 📤 Upload screenshot
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: screenshot
    path: screenshots
```


---

## 📦 Artifacts

When running on CI, the following files are uploaded as artifacts:

| File                        | Description                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `results.txt`               | Titles of the DuckDuckGo search results   |
| `screenshots/results.png`   | Screenshot after the search is executed   |
| `report.html`               | HTML log of the test execution (CI only)  |

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Integration

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test-ui.yml`) that:

- Installs Brave browser on Ubuntu runners.
- Sets up Selenium with a compatible ChromeDriver.
- Executes the `test_search.py` script in **headless mode** with a virtual display (Xvfb).
- Uploads the following artifacts:
  - `results.txt` – list of search results.
  - `screenshots/results.png` – screenshot of the search results page.
  - `report.html` – execution log in HTML format (via pytest).

To trigger the workflow, push changes to the `main` branch or open a Pull Request.
